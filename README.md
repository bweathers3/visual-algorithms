# Visual Algorithms

Thank you for your interest in contributing to [Visual Algorithms](http://visual-algorithms.surge.sh/)!

Visual Algorithms is a site intended to aid people in their study of common computer science algorithms. When an algorithm is brought to life through animations, students are able to better visualize how it works, as well as compare its efficiency relative to other algorithms.

The site is built using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](http://redux.js.org/).

## Examples

There are currently 2 pages - 1 for search algorithms and 1 for sort algorithms.

Select the speed of the algorithm in the upper right-hand corner, and then choose which algorithm you would like to see:

The speed can be changed at any time while the algorithm is running.

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to continue to expand Visual Algorithms and to make the current animations better/more useful. We are grateful for all contributions.

For details on how you can contribute, please read our [contributing guide](https://github.com/ianroberts131/visual-algorithms/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
