#Visual Algorithms

A demo of this project can be found [here](http://visual-algorithms.surge.sh/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

This application was built to combine my algorithm studies with learning React. The idea of the application is to create visual representations of key computer science algorithms to enhance understanding of how they work (and it also looks really cool). The visual representations of how these algorithms works really drives home the relative efficiency of each. So far the application only includes a sequential search and a binary search, but I plan to expand the number of algorithms as my studies continue.

Select the speed of the algorithm in the upper right-hand corner, and then choose which algorithm you would like to see:

The speed can be changed at any time while the algorithm is running. This is especially helpful with the slow sequential search:
